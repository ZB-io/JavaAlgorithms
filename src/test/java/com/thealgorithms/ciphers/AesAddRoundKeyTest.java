Scenario 1: Testing Normal Operation of addRoundKey

Details:
  TestName: testAddRoundKeyNormalOperation
  Description: The test is meant to evaluate the functionality of the addRoundKey method when it is given valid input in terms of BigInteger ciphertext and a BigInteger key.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two BigInteger variables to serve as the key and ciphertext.
  Act: Invoke the addRoundKey method, supplying the key and ciphertext as parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the output is the same as what you would find if you performed the XOR operation manually.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can effectively handle normal operation and provide the expected output. It is necessary because the XOR operation plays a crucial role in the AES algorithm and, specifically, the addRoundKey functionality.

Scenario 2: Testing Edge Case When Ciphertext or Key are large integers

Details:
  TestName: testAddRoundKeyWithLargeIntegers
  Description: The test will validate how the addRoundKey method behaves when given a very large ciphertext or key in the form of a BigInteger.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two BigInteger variables, one of them holding an unusually large integer.
  Act: Invoke the addRoundKey method, supplying the key and ciphertext as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the output with the expected outcome.

Validation:
  This test will verify the method's integrity when handling large integers, making it a critical test to guarantee the completeness and robustness of the code's functionality.

Scenario 3: Testing Edge Case When Ciphertext or Key are Null

Details:
  TestName: testAddRoundKeyWithNullInput
  Description: The test will assess how the addRoundKey method responds to null input for the key and ciphertext.

Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set any BigInteger variables; instead, pass null as parameters.
  Act: Invoke the addRoundKey method with null parameters.
  Assert: Check to see whether the method throws a NullPointerException.

Validation:
  This test is important because it certifies that the method is capable of handling exceptions, particularly a NullPointerException, and can prevent the application from crashing in the event of an unexpected occurrence.

Scenario 4: Testing Edge Case With Zero Inputs

Details:
  TestName: testAddRoundKeyWithZeroInput
  Description: This test will determine how the addRoundKey method performs when provided with zero as the key and ciphertext.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two BigInteger variables both holding zero.
  Act: Invoke the addRoundKey method by passing the initialized variables.
  Assert: Use JUnit methods to assert that the output is likewise zero.

Validation:
  The intention behind this test is to confirm the methodâ€™s functionality remains correct when working with zero inputs. As zero is often a problematic value in both multiplication and division operations, this test is crucial to safeguard against potential issues in the code.
