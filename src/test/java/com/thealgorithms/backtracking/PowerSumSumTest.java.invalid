Scenario 1: Testing the powSum method in PowerSum class with a positive n and x values

Details:  
    TestName: testPowSumWithPositiveInputs
    Description: This test is meant to ensure that the powSum method works correctly when both n and x are positive values. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the PowerSum class. No mocks or test doubles are necessary in this case.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with values such as 10 and 2.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is as expected.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the correct number of combinations are counted when both inputs are positive. The expected result is based on mathematical calculations related to the power sum formula.
    

Scenario 2: Testing the sum method with n equal to zero

Details:  
    TestName: testSumWithZeroNValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the sum method when the input value for n is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the PowerSum class.
    Act: Call the sum method with zero as the n value, and 1 and 1 for x and i values respectively.
    Assert: Check that the private 'count' variable is 0 after the method execution.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to confirm that when n is zero, no combinations are possible hence count should remain 0.
    

Scenario 3: Testing the sum method when x is zero 

Details:  
    TestName: testSumWhenXIsZero
    Description: This test is meant to confirm that the sum method can handle the value of x being zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the PowerSum class.
    Act: Call the sum method with 1 as the n value, zero as x value and 1 as i value.
    Assert: Check that the call does not result in any exception and 'count' variable remains unchanged as 0.
Validation:
    Our test aims to verify that if x is zero, the method does not result in any numerical errors as raising to power zero can have a special meaning.
    

Scenario 4: Testing the sum method when n is less than the sum of i raised to x

Details:  
    TestName: testSumWhenNIsLessThanPowerOfI
    Description: This test checks the scenario where n is less than i raised to the power x thereby making the sum of powers of integer i granter than n.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the PowerSum class.
    Act: Call the sum method with n being less than i raised to x (for example, n=1, x=2 and i=2).
    Assert: Confirm that the private 'count' variable does not increment and remains 0.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that if the potential next sum component i raised to x extends beyond n, the count doesn't increase as such a solution is invalid.
