"""
Scenario 1: Test Place Queens with valid number of queens
Details:
  TestName: testPlaceQueensValidNumber
  Description: This test is aimed to check the functionality of the placeQueens method when a valid number of queens is passed. A valid number of queens refers to a positive and non zero integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the class object and set a valid number for queens.
  Act: Invoke the placeQueen method by passing the valid number of Queens
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the correct arrangements are found and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function works as expected when valid input is given. It is important to ensure that the application can handle and operate on valid input correctly.

Scenario 2: Test Place Queens with invalid number of queens
Details:
  TestName: testPlaceQueensInvalidNumber
  Description: This test is aimed towards checking the handling of the placeQueens method when an invalid number of queens is passed. An invalid number might mean a negative number or zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the class object and set the invalid number for queens.
  Act: Invoke the placeQueen method by passing the invalid number of Queens.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the appropriate error or response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function can handle and respond appropriately to invalid input. This ensures that the application is robust and can prevent errors or mishandling of data.

Scenario 3: Test Place Queens with large number of queens
Details:
  TestName: testPlaceQueensLargeNumber
  Description: This test is aimed to check the efficiency of the placeQueens method when a large number of queens are passed. This test is useful to understand the performance of the algorithm in edge case scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the class object and set a large number for queens.
  Act: Invoke the placeQueen method by passing the large number of Queens
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the correct arrangements are found within an acceptable time frame and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the efficiency and performance of the function when dealing with large input values. This test is significant in understanding the application behavior or business logic when dealing with large datasets.
