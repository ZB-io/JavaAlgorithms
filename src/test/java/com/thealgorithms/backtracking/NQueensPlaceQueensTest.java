"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the placement of one queen
Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceOneQueen.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly places one queen on a 1x1 board. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is only one queen.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with parameter 1, which is the number of queens to be placed.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the queen is correctly placed on the 1x1 board.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the program correctly places one queen on a 1x1 board. The expected result is a correct placement because there is only one queen and it can be placed anywhere on the board. This test is important to ensure that the basic functionality of the program works correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the placement of multiple queens
Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceMultipleQueens.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly places multiple queens on a larger board. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the program should place the queens correctly.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with a parameter greater than 1, which is the number of queens to be placed.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the queens are correctly placed on the board.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the program correctly places multiple queens on a larger board. The expected result is a correct placement because the program should be able to place multiple queens on a board without them attacking each other. This test is important to ensure that the program can handle more complex scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the placement of no queens
Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceNoQueens.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly handles the scenario where no queens are to be placed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as no queens are to be placed.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with parameter 0, which is the number of queens to be placed.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the program correctly handles the scenario.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the program correctly handles the scenario where no queens are to be placed. The expected result is a message saying that there is no way to place 0 queens on a 0x0 board. This test is important to ensure that the program can handle edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Test to verify the placement of queens on a board that is too small
Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceQueensOnSmallBoard.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly handles the scenario where the board is too small for the number of queens to be placed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the program should handle this scenario correctly.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with a parameter greater than the size of the board.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the program correctly handles the scenario.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the program correctly handles the scenario where the board is too small for the number of queens to be placed. The expected result is a message saying that there is no way to place the queens on the board. This test is important to ensure that the program can handle error scenarios correctly.
