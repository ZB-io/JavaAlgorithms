"Scenario 1: Testing combination method with k value greater than n
Details:  
  TestName: testWhenKIsGreaterThanN
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the combination method when the length of the combination (k) is greater than the max value of the array (n). Since it is impossible to generate combinations of length greater than the total elements, this scenario should be handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are directly providing the input parameters.
  Act: Invoke combination method with n=2 and k=3.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that when the length of the combination is greater than the total elements, the method is returning null. This is because it's impossible to generate combinations of length greater than the total number of elements.

Scenario 2: Testing combination method with negative k value
Details:  
  TestName: testWhenKIsNegative
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the combination method when the length of the combination (k) is negative. Since negative length doesn't make sense, the scenario should be handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are directly providing the input parameters.
  Act: Invoke combination method with n=2 and k=-1.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that when the length of the combination is negative, the method is returning null. This is because having a negative length is not valid in the context of generating combinations.

Scenario 3: Testing combination method with n as a large number
Details:  
  TestName: testWithLargeN
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the combination method when the max value of the array (n) is a large number. This test checks the performance and correctness of the method under stress.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are directly providing the input parameters.
  Act: Invoke combination method with n=10000 and k=2.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is not null and its size is as expected.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method is able to handle large inputs correctly and efficiently.

Scenario 4: Testing combination method with k as zero and n as positive integer
Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroKAndPositiveN
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the combination method when the length of the combination (k) is zero and the max value of the array (n) is a positive integer. According to the method definition, if k is zero, the method should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are directly providing the input parameters.
  Act: Invoke combination method with n=2 and k=0.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that when the length of the combination is zero, the method is returning null. This is in accordance with the method definition.
