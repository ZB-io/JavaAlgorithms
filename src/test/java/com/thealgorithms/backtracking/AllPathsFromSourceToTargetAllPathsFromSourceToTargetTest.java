Scenario 1: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a null graph.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNullGraph.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a null graph. A null graph is passed as the input parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: A null graph is created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the null graph as the parameter.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a null graph, which is an invalid input. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.

Scenario 2: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a graph with negative vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeVertices.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a graph with negative vertices. A graph with negative vertices is passed as the input parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph with negative vertices is created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph as the parameter.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a graph with negative vertices, which is an invalid input. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.

Scenario 3: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a graph with no edges.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNoEdges.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a graph with no edges. A graph with no edges is passed as the input parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph with no edges is created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph as the parameter.
  Assert: An empty list is expected to be returned.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a graph with no edges. The expected result is an empty list, as there are no paths from the source to the target in a graph with no edges.

Scenario 4: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a source vertex that doesn't exist in the graph.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNonExistentSourceVertex.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a source vertex that doesn't exist in the graph. A graph and a non-existent source vertex are passed as the input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph and a non-existent source vertex are created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph and the non-existent source vertex as the parameters.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a non-existent source vertex, which is an invalid input. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.

Scenario 5: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a destination vertex that doesn't exist in the graph.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNonExistentDestinationVertex.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a destination vertex that doesn't exist in the graph. A graph and a non-existent destination vertex are passed as the input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph and a non-existent destination vertex are created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph and the non-existent destination vertex as the parameters.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a non-existent destination vertex, which is an invalid input. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.
