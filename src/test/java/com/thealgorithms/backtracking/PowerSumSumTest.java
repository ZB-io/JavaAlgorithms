Scenario 1: Test to check if sum function returns correct count for valid inputs

Details:  
  TestName: testSumFunctionWithValidInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function returns the correct count for valid inputs. We are checking the functionality of the sum function when it is provided with valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: We need to initialize the PowerSum class and set the values of n, x and i as per our test data.
  Act: We call the sum function using the object of PowerSum class with the values of n, x and i that we have set.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual count returned by the sum function against the expected count.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the sum function is able to correctly calculate the count for valid inputs. The expected result is based on the mathematical calculations and the business logic of the sum function. This test is significant as it tests the core functionality of the sum function.

Scenario 2: Test to check if sum function handles negative inputs correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSumFunctionWithNegativeInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function is able to handle negative inputs correctly. We are checking the functionality of the sum function when it is provided with negative values of n, x and i.
Execution:
  Arrange: We need to initialize the PowerSum class and set the values of n, x and i as per our test data with negative values.
  Act: We call the sum function using the object of PowerSum class with the values of n, x and i that we have set.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual count returned by the sum function against the expected count.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the sum function is able to handle negative inputs correctly. The expected result is based on the mathematical calculations and the business logic of the sum function. This test is significant as it tests the error handling capability of the sum function.

Scenario 3: Test to check if sum function handles zero inputs correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSumFunctionWithZeroInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function is able to handle zero inputs correctly. We are checking the functionality of the sum function when it is provided with zero values of n, x and i.
Execution:
  Arrange: We need to initialize the PowerSum class and set the values of n, x and i as per our test data with zero values.
  Act: We call the sum function using the object of PowerSum class with the values of n, x and i that we have set.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual count returned by the sum function against the expected count.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the sum function is able to handle zero inputs correctly. The expected result is based on the mathematical calculations and the business logic of the sum function. This test is significant as it tests the error handling capability of the sum function.
