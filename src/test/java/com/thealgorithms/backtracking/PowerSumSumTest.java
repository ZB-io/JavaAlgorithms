Scenario 1: Test to check if sum function returns correct count for valid inputs

Details:  
  TestName: testSumFunctionWithValidInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function returns the correct count for valid inputs. We are checking the functionality of the sum function when it is provided with valid inputs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PowerSum object and provide it with valid inputs.
  Act: Invoke the sum function with the appropriate parameters or conditions. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the count returned by the sum function is correct. The expected result is based on the known output for the given inputs. This test is significant as it ensures that the sum function is working as expected with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test to check if sum function handles edge case inputs correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSumFunctionWithEdgeCaseInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function handles edge case inputs correctly. We are checking the functionality of the sum function when it is provided with inputs at the edge of the valid input range. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PowerSum object and provide it with edge case inputs.
  Act: Invoke the sum function with the appropriate parameters or conditions. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the count returned by the sum function is correct even for edge case inputs. The expected result is based on the known output for the given inputs. This test is significant as it ensures that the sum function handles edge case inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if sum function handles invalid inputs correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSumFunctionWithInvalidInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function handles invalid inputs correctly. We are checking the functionality of the sum function when it is provided with invalid inputs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PowerSum object and provide it with invalid inputs.
  Act: Invoke the sum function with the appropriate parameters or conditions. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the function throws the expected exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the sum function throws the expected exception when provided with invalid inputs. This test is significant as it ensures that the sum function handles invalid inputs correctly and doesn't result in unexpected behavior of the application.

Scenario 4: Test to check if sum function handles zero correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSumFunctionWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function handles zero correctly. We are checking the functionality of the sum function when it is provided with zero as an input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PowerSum object and provide it with zero as an input.
  Act: Invoke the sum function with the appropriate parameters or conditions. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the count returned by the sum function is correct when zero is provided as an input. The expected result is based on the known output for the given inputs. This test is significant as it ensures that the sum function handles zero correctly.
