Scenario 1: Test to validate if edge is added successfully between two vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeSuccessfully
  Description: This test is meant to check if the edge is added successfully between two vertices in the graph. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with two vertices as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the first vertex against an expected list containing the second vertex.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the second vertex is present in the adjacency list of the first vertex, confirming that the edge has been added successfully. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the addEdge method.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if addEdge handles invalid vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeWithInvalidVertices
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method handles the case when invalid or out-of-range vertices are provided as parameters. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with two vertices, where at least one vertex is out of range. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the addEdge method throws an exception when provided with invalid vertices, ensuring that the graph's integrity is maintained. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the addEdge method.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if addEdge handles adding an edge to itself.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeToItself
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method handles the case when a vertex is trying to add an edge to itself. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with the same vertex as both parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the vertex against an expected list containing itself.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the vertex is present in its own adjacency list, confirming that a vertex can have an edge to itself. This test is significant as it checks the addEdge method's functionality in a special case scenario.
