Scenario 1: Test for valid path in the maze with no obstacles

Details:  
  TestName: testValidPathWithoutObstacles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay method can successfully find a path in a maze with no obstacles, starting from the initial point (1,1) to the end point (6,5). 

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D maze array with no obstacles except the walls at the boundaries. 
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze array, and the initial x and y coordinates (1,1).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome which is true.

Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setWay method can correctly navigate through a maze with no obstacles. The expected result is true because there is a clear path from the starting point to the end point. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the setWay method.


Scenario 2: Test for no valid path in the maze due to obstacles

Details:  
  TestName: testNoPathDueToObstacles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay method correctly returns false when there is no valid path in the maze due to obstacles.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D maze array with obstacles such that there is no path from the initial point (1,1) to the end point (6,5).
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze array, and the initial x and y coordinates (1,1).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome which is false.

Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setWay method correctly identifies when there is no valid path in the maze. The expected result is false because there is no path from the starting point to the end point due to obstacles. This test is significant as it verifies the setWay method's ability to correctly identify unfeasible paths.


Scenario 3: Test for valid path in the maze with obstacles

Details:  
  TestName: testValidPathWithObstacles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay method can successfully find a path in a maze with obstacles, starting from the initial point (1,1) to the end point (6,5). 

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D maze array with obstacles but there is a clear path from the initial point to the end point.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze array, and the initial x and y coordinates (1,1).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome which is true.

Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setWay method can correctly navigate through a maze with obstacles. The expected result is true because there is a clear path from the starting point to the end point despite the obstacles. This test is significant as it verifies the setWay method's ability to navigate complex mazes.
