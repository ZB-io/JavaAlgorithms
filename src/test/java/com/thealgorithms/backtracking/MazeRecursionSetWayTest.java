Scenario 1: Test for valid path in the maze with no obstacles

Details:  
  TestName: testValidPathWithoutObstacles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay method can successfully find a path in a maze with no obstacles, starting from the initial point (1,1) to the end point (6,5). 

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D maze array with no obstacles except the walls at the boundaries. 
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze array, and the initial x and y coordinates (1,1).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome which is true.

Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setWay method can correctly navigate through a maze with no obstacles. The expected result is true because there is a clear path from the starting point to the end point. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the setWay method.

Scenario 2: Test for no valid path in the maze due to obstacles

Details:  
  TestName: testNoPathDueToObstacles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay method correctly returns false when there is no valid path in the maze due to obstacles.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D maze array with obstacles blocking the path from the initial to the end point.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze array, and the initial x and y coordinates (1,1).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome which is false.

Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setWay method correctly identifies when there is no valid path in the maze due to obstacles. The expected result is false because the obstacles in the maze block the path from the start to the end point. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to handle scenarios where no valid path exists.

Scenario 3: Test for valid path in the maze with obstacles

Details:  
  TestName: testValidPathWithObstacles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay method can successfully find a path in a maze with obstacles, navigating around the obstacles from the initial point (1,1) to the end point (6,5).

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D maze array with obstacles that do not completely block the path from the initial to the end point.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze array, and the initial x and y coordinates (1,1).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome which is true.

Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setWay method can correctly navigate around obstacles in the maze to find a valid path. The expected result is true because there is a clear path around the obstacles from the starting point to the end point. This test is significant as it verifies the method's ability to handle complex scenarios with obstacles in the maze.
  
Scenario 4: Test for invalid initial point in the maze

Details:  
  TestName: testInvalidInitialPoint
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay method correctly returns false when the initial point is invalid (i.e., it is a wall or an obstacle).

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D maze array with the initial point being a wall or an obstacle.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the maze array, and the initial x and y coordinates (1,1) being a wall or an obstacle.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome which is false.

Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setWay method correctly identifies invalid initial points. The expected result is false because the initial point is a wall or an obstacle, and hence, the ball cannot start from this point. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to handle invalid initial points.
