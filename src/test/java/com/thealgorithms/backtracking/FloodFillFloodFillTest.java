Scenario 1: Testing for a 2D image with different colors and replacing a color that is present.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithDifferentColors
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the floodFill method when it is called with an image that has different colors and the oldColor is present in the image. It should replace all instances of the oldColor with the newColor. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D image with different colors. Set the newColor and oldColor such that oldColor is present in the image.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the created image, newColor, and oldColor.
  Assert: Check if all instances of the oldColor in the image have been replaced with the newColor.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if the floodFill method correctly replaces all instances of the oldColor with the newColor in the image. This is important to ensure that the color filling operation is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing for a 2D image with different colors and replacing a color that is not present.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithAbsentColor
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the floodFill method when it is called with an image that has different colors and the oldColor is not present in the image. It should not make any changes to the image. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D image with different colors. Set the newColor and oldColor such that oldColor is not present in the image.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the created image, newColor, and oldColor.
  Assert: Check if the image remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if the floodFill method does not make any changes to the image when the oldColor is not present. This is important to ensure that the color filling operation is working as expected.

Scenario 3: Testing for a 2D image with the same color and replacing it with a different color.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithSameColor
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the floodFill method when it is called with an image that has the same color for all pixels and the oldColor is the same as the color of the pixels. It should replace all the pixels with the newColor. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D image with the same color for all pixels. Set the newColor and oldColor such that oldColor is the same as the color of the pixels.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the created image, newColor, and oldColor.
  Assert: Check if all pixels in the image have been replaced with the newColor.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if the floodFill method correctly replaces all pixels in the image with the newColor. This is important to ensure that the color filling operation is working as expected.

Scenario 4: Testing for a 2D image with the same color and trying to replace it with the same color.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithSameColorAndSameReplacement
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the floodFill method when it is called with an image that has the same color for all pixels and the newColor is the same as the oldColor. It should not make any changes to the image. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D image with the same color for all pixels. Set the newColor and oldColor such that they are the same.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the created image, newColor, and oldColor.
  Assert: Check if the image remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if the floodFill method does not make any changes to the image when the newColor is the same as the oldColor. This is important to ensure that the color filling operation is working as expected.

Scenario 5: Testing for a 2D image with negative coordinates.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithNegativeCoordinates
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the floodFill method when it is called with negative coordinates. It should not make any changes to the image. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D image with different colors. Set the newColor and oldColor such that oldColor is present in the image. Set the coordinates as negative values.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the created image, newColor, oldColor, and the negative coordinates.
  Assert: Check if the image remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if the floodFill method does not make any changes to the image when the coordinates are negative. This is important to ensure that the color filling operation is working as expected and it does not modify the image when the coordinates are out of bounds.
