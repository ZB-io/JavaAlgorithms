Scenario 1: Test to verify the placement of a single queen
Details:  
  TestName: testSingleQueenPlacement
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can handle the placement of a single queen. The target scenario is where there is only one queen to be placed on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the NQueens class and set the number of queens to 1.
  Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with 1 as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome of one queen being placed on the board.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle the placement of a single queen. The expected result is that one queen is placed on the board because this is the minimum number of queens that can be placed on a board. This test is significant in ensuring that the method can handle the edge case of having only one queen.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the placement of multiple queens
Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleQueensPlacement
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can handle the placement of multiple queens. The target scenario is where there are multiple queens to be placed on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the NQueens class and set the number of queens to a number greater than 1.
  Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with the number of queens as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome of multiple queens being placed on the board.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle the placement of multiple queens. The expected result is that multiple queens are placed on the board because this is a typical scenario that the method should be able to handle. This test is significant in ensuring that the method functions as expected when dealing with multiple queens.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the placement of no queens
Details:  
  TestName: testNoQueensPlacement
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can handle the placement of no queens. The target scenario is where there are no queens to be placed on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the NQueens class and set the number of queens to 0.
  Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with 0 as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome of no queens being placed on the board.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle the placement of no queens. The expected result is that no queens are placed on the board because this is the edge case where there are no queens to place. This test is significant in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases.
