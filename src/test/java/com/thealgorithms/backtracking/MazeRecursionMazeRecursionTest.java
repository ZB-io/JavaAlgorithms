""" 
Scenario 1: Testing mazeRecursion with a default map

Details:  
  TestName: testMazeRecursionWithDefaultMap
  Description: This test is to verify that the mazeRecursion method correctly initializes the maze map and prints the maze map before and after calling setWay and setWay2 methods. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to set up any data as the mazeRecursion method creates the map internally.
  Act: Invoke the mazeRecursion method.
  Assert: Check the printed output of the maze map before and after calling setWay and setWay2 methods.
Validation: 
  This test is to ensure that the maze map is initialized correctly and the setWay and setWay2 methods are called correctly on the map. The expected result is the printed output of the maze map before and after calling setWay and setWay2 methods.

Scenario 2: Testing setWay method with a default map

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWayWithDefaultMap
  Description: This test is to verify that the setWay method correctly finds a path in the maze map. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a default maze map.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the created map and the starting point as parameters.
  Assert: Check the return value of the setWay method.
Validation: 
  This test is to ensure that the setWay method correctly finds a path in the maze map. The expected result is true if a path is found, else false.

Scenario 3: Testing setWay2 method with a default map

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWay2WithDefaultMap
  Description: This test is to verify that the setWay2 method correctly finds a path in the maze map. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a default maze map.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the created map and the starting point as parameters.
  Assert: Check the return value of the setWay2 method.
Validation: 
  This test is to ensure that the setWay2 method correctly finds a path in the maze map. The expected result is true if a path is found, else false.

Scenario 4: Testing setWay method with a map that has no path

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWayWithNoPathMap
  Description: This test is to verify that the setWay method correctly handles a map that has no path. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a maze map that has no path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the created map and the starting point as parameters.
  Assert: Check the return value of the setWay method.
Validation: 
  This test is to ensure that the setWay method correctly handles a map that has no path. The expected result is false.

Scenario 5: Testing setWay2 method with a map that has no path

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWay2WithNoPathMap
  Description: This test is to verify that the setWay2 method correctly handles a map that has no path. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a maze map that has no path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the created map and the starting point as parameters.
  Assert: Check the return value of the setWay2 method.
Validation: 
  This test is to ensure that the setWay2 method correctly handles a map that has no path. The expected result is false.
