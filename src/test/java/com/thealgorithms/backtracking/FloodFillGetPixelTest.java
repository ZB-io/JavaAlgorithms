Scenario 1: Validate the correct color at the given coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: validateCorrectPixelColor
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method returns the correct color at the given coordinates.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array and set a known color at a specific coordinate.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with the coordinates of the known color.
    Assert: Assert that the returned color matches the known color.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getPixel method accurately retrieves the color at the given coordinates. The expected result is the known color because it was set at the given coordinates in the Arrange step.

Scenario 2: Validate behavior with out-of-bound coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: validateOutOfBoundsPixel
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method throws an exception when given out-of-bound coordinates.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with coordinates that are out of the image array's bounds.
    Assert: Assert that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getPixel method correctly throws an exception when given out-of-bound coordinates. The expected result is an exception because the coordinates are outside the range of the image array.

Scenario 3: Validate behavior with negative coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: validateNegativePixelCoordinates
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method throws an exception when given negative coordinates.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with negative coordinates.
    Assert: Assert that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getPixel method correctly throws an exception when given negative coordinates. The expected result is an exception because negative coordinates are not valid for an array.

Scenario 4: Validate behavior with null image
  Details:
    TestName: validateNullImage
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method throws an exception when the image is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the image is null.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with null as the image.
    Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getPixel method correctly throws an exception when the image is null. The expected result is an exception because a null image does not have any pixels to get color from.
