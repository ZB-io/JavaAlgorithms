ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getPixel_32782947c7

Scenario 1: Validate the correct color at the given coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: validateCorrectPixelColor
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method returns the correct color at the given coordinates.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array and set a known color at a specific coordinate.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with the coordinates of the known color.
    Assert: Assert that the returned color matches the known color.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getPixel method accurately retrieves the color at the given coordinates. This is crucial as it ensures the integrity of the image data.

Scenario 2: Validate the behavior for out of bounds coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: validateOutOfBoundsCoordinates
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when given coordinates that are out of bounds.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with coordinates that are out of the bounds of the image array.
    Assert: Assert that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getPixel method correctly handles out of bounds coordinates by throwing an exception. This is important for preventing unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.

Scenario 3: Validate the behavior for negative coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: validateNegativeCoordinates
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when given negative coordinates.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with negative coordinates.
    Assert: Assert that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that the getPixel method correctly handles negative coordinates by throwing an exception. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the image data and preventing unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Validate the behavior for null image
  Details:
    TestName: validateNullImage
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method throws a NullPointerException when the image is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the image to null.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with any coordinates.
    Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getPixel method correctly handles a null image by throwing an exception. This is important for preventing unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
