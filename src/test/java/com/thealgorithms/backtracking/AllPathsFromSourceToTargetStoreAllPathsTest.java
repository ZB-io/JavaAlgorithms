"""
Scenario 1: Test the method with valid source and destination nodes

Details:
  TestName: testWithValidSourceAndDestinationNodes
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly stores all possible paths from the source node to the destination node in a graph.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the AllPathsFromSourceToTarget class and add edges to the graph.
  Act: Invoke the storeAllPaths method with valid source and destination nodes.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned paths are as expected.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly identifies all paths from the source to the destination. If the paths are correctly identified, it indicates that the method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test the method with source node equal to the destination node

Details:
  TestName: testWithSourceEqualToDestination
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles the scenario where the source node is the same as the destination node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the AllPathsFromSourceToTarget class and add edges to the graph.
  Act: Invoke the storeAllPaths method with source node equal to the destination node.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned paths are as expected.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles the scenario where the source node is the same as the destination node. If the returned paths are as expected, it indicates that the method is working as expected.

Scenario 3: Test the method when there are no paths from the source to the destination

Details:
  TestName: testWithNoPathsFromSourceToDestination
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles the scenario where there are no paths from the source node to the destination node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the AllPathsFromSourceToTarget class and add edges to the graph such that there are no paths from the source to the destination.
  Act: Invoke the storeAllPaths method with the source and destination nodes.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned paths are empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles the scenario where there are no paths from the source to the destination. If the returned paths are empty, it indicates that the method is working as expected.

Scenario 4: Test the method when the graph is empty

Details:
  TestName: testWithEmptyGraph
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles the scenario where the graph is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the AllPathsFromSourceToTarget class without adding any edges to the graph.
  Act: Invoke the storeAllPaths method with any source and destination nodes.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned paths are empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles the scenario where the graph is empty. If the returned paths are empty, it indicates that the method is working as expected.
