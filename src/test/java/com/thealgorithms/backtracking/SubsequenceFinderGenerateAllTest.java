"""" 
Scenario 1: Test with an empty list

Details:  
  TestName: testWithEmptyList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when an empty list is provided as input. The method should return a list containing an empty list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with the empty list as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains a single element, which is an empty list.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles an empty list as input and returns the expected output. This test is important as it verifies the correct handling of edge cases.

Scenario 2: Test with a list containing a single element

Details:  
  TestName: testWithSingleElement
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a list containing a single element is provided as input. The method should return a list containing two lists, one empty and one with the single element. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list containing a single element. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with the single-element list as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains two lists, one empty and one with the single element.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly generates all subsequences for a list containing a single element. This test is significant as it verifies the correct handling of minimal input.

Scenario 3: Test with a list containing multiple elements

Details:  
  TestName: testWithMultipleElements
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a list containing multiple elements is provided as input. The method should return a list containing all possible subsequences of the input list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list containing multiple elements. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with the multi-element list as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains all expected subsequences.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly generates all subsequences for a list containing multiple elements. This test is significant as it verifies the method's core functionality.

Scenario 4: Test with a list containing duplicate elements

Details:  
  TestName: testWithDuplicateElements
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a list containing duplicate elements is provided as input. The method should return a list containing all possible subsequences, including those that involve the duplicate elements. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list containing duplicate elements. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with the duplicate-element list as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains all expected subsequences, including those that involve the duplicate elements.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles lists with duplicate elements. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to handle complex scenarios.

Scenario 5: Test with a null list

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNullList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when null is provided as input. The method should throw a NullPointerException. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the input is null. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with null as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly throws an exception when null is provided as input. This test is important as it verifies the method's error handling capabilities.
