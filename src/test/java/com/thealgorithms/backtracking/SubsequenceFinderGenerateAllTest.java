"""" 
Scenario 1: Test with an empty list

Details:  
  TestName: testWithEmptyList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when an empty list is provided as input. The method should return a list containing an empty list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with the empty list.
  Assert: Assert that the result is a list containing an empty list.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles an empty input list by returning a list containing an empty list. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 2: Test with a list containing a single element

Details:  
  TestName: testWithSingleElementList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a list containing a single element is provided as input. The method should return a list containing two lists, one empty and one with the single element. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list containing a single element. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with the single-element list.
  Assert: Assert that the result is a list containing two lists, one empty and one with the single element.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly generates all subsequences of a list containing a single element. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to handle minimal non-empty input.

Scenario 3: Test with a list containing multiple elements

Details:  
  TestName: testWithMultipleElementsList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a list containing multiple elements is provided as input. The method should return a list containing all possible subsequences of the input list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list containing multiple elements. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with the multiple-elements list.
  Assert: Assert that the result is a list containing all possible subsequences of the input list.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly generates all subsequences of a list containing multiple elements. This test is significant as it checks the method's main functionality.

Scenario 4: Test with a null list

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNullList
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a null list is provided as input. The method should throw a NullPointerException. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the input is null. 
  Act: Invoke generateAll with null.
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles a null input by throwing a NullPointerException. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling capability.
