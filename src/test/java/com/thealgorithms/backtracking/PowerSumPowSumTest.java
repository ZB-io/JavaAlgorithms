Scenario 1: Validate powSum functionality when the input number is negative and power one.
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeNumberAndPowerOne
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the powSum method when the input number is negative and the power is one. The method should return a zero count as negative numbers are not valid for this calculation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with -10 as the number and 1 as the power.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a zero count.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly handles negative numbers by returning a zero count. This is significant for ensuring the method can handle invalid input.

Scenario 2: Validate powSum functionality when the input number is positive and power is zero.
Details:  
  TestName: testPositiveNumberAndPowerZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the powSum method when the input number is positive and the power is zero. The method should return a count of one as any number raised to the power zero is one.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with 10 as the number and 0 as the power.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a count of one.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly calculates the power of zero, returning a count of one. This is significant for ensuring the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Validate powSum functionality when the input number is zero and power is positive.
Details:  
  TestName: testZeroNumberAndPositivePower
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the powSum method when the input number is zero and the power is positive. The method should return a count of zero as zero raised to any positive power is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with 0 as the number and 10 as the power.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a zero count.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly calculates when the number is zero, returning a count of zero. This is significant for ensuring the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Validate powSum functionality when the input number and power are both positive.
Details:  
  TestName: testPositiveNumberAndPositivePower
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the powSum method when both the input number and power are positive. The method should return a count of the number of ways the number can be expressed as the sum of unique natural numbers raised to the power.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a PowerSum object.
    Act: Invoke the powSum method with a positive number and power.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a count of the number of ways the number can be expressed as the sum of unique natural numbers raised to the power.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly calculates the count. This is significant for ensuring the method can handle typical use cases.
