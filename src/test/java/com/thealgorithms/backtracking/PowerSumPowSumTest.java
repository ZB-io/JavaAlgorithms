"Scenario 1: Testing with Negative Values
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeValues.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the powSum method behaves when negative values are provided as input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PowerSum object.
  Act: Invoke the powSum method with negative values for n and x.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0 since negative values for n and x are not valid.
Validation: 
  This test aims to verify if the powSum method correctly handles negative input values. The expected result is 0 because the method is not designed to calculate negative powers or sums.

Scenario 2: Testing with Large Values
Details:
  TestName: testLargeValues.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the powSum method behaves when large values are provided as input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PowerSum object.
  Act: Invoke the powSum method with large values for n and x.
  Assert: Assert that the result is correct by manually calculating the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  This test aims to verify if the powSum method correctly calculates the power sum for large input values. The expected result is a manually calculated value, ensuring that the method works correctly even with large inputs.

Scenario 3: Testing with Zero as Power
Details:
  TestName: testZeroAsPower.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the powSum method behaves when the power, x, is set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PowerSum object.
  Act: Invoke the powSum method with 0 as the value for x.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 1 since any number raised to the power of zero is 1.
Validation: 
  This test aims to verify if the powSum method correctly handles a scenario where the power is zero. The expected result is 1, based on the mathematical rule that any number raised to the power of zero is 1.

Scenario 4: Testing with One as the Number and Power
Details:
  TestName: testOneAsNumberAndPower.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the powSum method behaves when both the number, n, and the power, x, are set to one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PowerSum object.
  Act: Invoke the powSum method with 1 as the values for n and x.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 1 since 1 raised to the power of 1 is 1.
Validation: 
  This test aims to verify if the powSum method correctly handles a scenario where both the number and the power are one. The expected result is 1, based on the mathematical rule that 1 raised to the power of 1 is 1.
