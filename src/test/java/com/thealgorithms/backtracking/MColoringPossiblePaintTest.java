  Scenario 1: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are connected and the number of colors is enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithEnoughColors.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method can correctly handle the situation where all nodes are connected and the number of colors is sufficient to color all nodes without any two adjacent nodes having the same color. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected. Set the number of colors to the number of nodes.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is possible to color all nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color when the number of colors is sufficient. This is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the graph coloring algorithm.

  Scenario 2: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are isolated.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithIsolatedNodes.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method can correctly handle the situation where all nodes are isolated, i.e., no edges between any nodes. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are isolated. Set the number of colors to 1.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is possible to color all nodes with one color when all nodes are isolated. This is important in ensuring the accuracy of the graph coloring algorithm in edge cases.

  Scenario 3: Test the graph coloring when the number of colors is not enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithInsufficientColors.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method can correctly handle the situation where the number of colors is not enough to color all nodes without any two adjacent nodes having the same color. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected. Set the number of colors to a number less than the number of nodes.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is 0.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is not possible to color all nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color when the number of colors is insufficient. This is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the graph coloring algorithm.

  Scenario 4: Test the graph coloring with an empty graph.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithEmptyGraph.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method can correctly handle the situation where the graph is empty, i.e., no nodes in the graph. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty graph. Set the number of colors to any number.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is possible to color all nodes (which are none in this case) with any number of colors when the graph is empty. This is important in ensuring the accuracy of the graph coloring algorithm in edge cases.
