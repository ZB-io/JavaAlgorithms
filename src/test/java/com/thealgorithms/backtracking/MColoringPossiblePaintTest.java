Scenario 1: Test with maximal color limit
Details:
    TestName: testMaximalColorLimit
    Description: The test checks the scenario when the maximum number of colors is just enough to paint the graph nodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a graph where each node is connected to every other node. Set the number of colors to the number of nodes in the graph.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph, the number of nodes as n, and the number of nodes as m.
    Assert: The expected result is 1 indicating it's possible to paint the graph with the given colors.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that given a maximal number of colors equals to the number of nodes, the graph can be painted. The test demonstrates a successful usage scenario of graph coloring.

Scenario 2: Test with insufficient color limit
Details:
    TestName: testInsufficientColorLimit
    Description: The test checks the scenario when the number of colors is less than required to paint the graph nodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a fully-connected graph with basically more than two nodes. Set the number of colors to 2.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph, the number of nodes as n, and 2 as m.
    Assert: The expected result is 0 indicating it's impossible to paint the graph with the given colors.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that given an insufficient number of colors, the graph cannot be painted. The test demonstrates a failure scenario of graph coloring.

Scenario 3: Test when one or no edge formed
Details:
    TestName: testSingleOrNoEdgeFormed
    Description: The test checks the scenario when graph has only one node or no edges at all.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a graph containing one node, or having nodes that are not connected. Set any number of colors.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph, the number of nodes as n, and any number as m.
    Assert: The expected result is 1 indicating it's possible to paint the graph with the given colors.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that if there are no edges in the graph or only one node exists, the graph can always be painted regardless the number of colors. This test explores the edge case of possiblePaint function.

Scenario 4: Test with fully disconnected nodes
Details:
    TestName: testFullyDisconnectedNodes
    Description: The test checks the scenario when all nodes in the graph are disconnected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph with disconnected nodes only. Set the number of colors to 1.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph, the number of nodes as n, and 1 as m.
    Assert: The expected result is 1 indicating it's possible to paint the graph with the given colors.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that if the graph nodes are all disconnected, the graph can always be painted with just 1 color.
