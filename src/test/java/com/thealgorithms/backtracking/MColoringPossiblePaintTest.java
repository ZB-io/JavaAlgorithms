  Scenario 1: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are connected and the number of colors is enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithEnoughColors.
    Description: This test is designed to check the scenario where all nodes in the graph are connected and the number of colors available is enough to color all nodes. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected and the number of colors is equal to the number of nodes. 
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: The output should be 1, indicating that it's possible to color the graph with the given colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that the graph can be colored with the given colors. 
    This test validates the basic functionality of the method with a simple connected graph.

  Scenario 2: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are connected and the number of colors is not enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithInadequateColors.
    Description: This test is designed to check the scenario where all nodes in the graph are connected but the number of colors available is not enough to color all nodes. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected and the number of colors is less than the number of nodes. 
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: The output should be 0, indicating that it's not possible to color the graph with the given colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that the graph cannot be colored with the given colors. 
    This test validates the method's ability to handle scenarios where the number of colors is not enough.

  Scenario 3: Test the graph coloring with an empty graph.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithEmptyGraph.
    Description: This test is designed to check the scenario where the graph is empty, meaning there are no nodes. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty graph. 
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the empty graph and any number of colors.
    Assert: The output should be 1, indicating that it's possible to color the graph with the given colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that the graph can be colored with the given colors, even though there are no nodes to color. 
    This test validates the method's ability to handle edge cases where the graph is empty.

  Scenario 4: Test the graph coloring with a disconnected graph.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithDisconnectedGraph.
    Description: This test is designed to check the scenario where the graph is disconnected, meaning there are nodes that are not connected to any other nodes. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where some nodes are not connected to any other nodes. 
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the disconnected graph and any number of colors.
    Assert: The output should be 1, indicating that it's possible to color the graph with the given colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that the graph can be colored with the given colors, even though there are disconnected nodes. 
    This test validates the method's ability to handle edge cases where the graph is disconnected.
