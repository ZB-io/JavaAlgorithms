Scenario 1: Test to validate if edge is added successfully between two vertices.

Details:
  TestName: testAddEdgeSuccessfully
  Description: This test is meant to check if the edge is added successfully between two vertices in the graph.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices.
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with two vertices as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the first vertex against an expected list containing the second vertex.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the second vertex is present in the adjacency list of the first vertex, confirming that the edge has been added successfully. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the addEdge method.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if addEdge handles invalid vertices.

Details:
  TestName: testAddEdgeWithInvalidVertices
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method handles the case when invalid or out-of-range vertices are provided as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices.
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with two vertices, where at least one vertex is out of range.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown, indicating that the vertices provided are invalid. This test is important as it checks the error handling capability of the addEdge method.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if addEdge handles multiple edges between same vertices.

Details:
  TestName: testAddEdgeMultipleTimesBetweenSameVertices
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method handles the case when multiple edges are added between the same vertices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices.
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method multiple times with the same pair of vertices as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the first vertex against an expected list containing multiple instances of the second vertex.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the second vertex is present multiple times in the adjacency list of the first vertex, confirming that multiple edges have been added successfully. This test is significant as it checks the ability of the addEdge method to handle multiple edges between the same vertices.
