Scenario 1: All paths, Vertices, edges are valid and present

Details:
 TestName: testAddValidEdges.
 Description: This test will validate the addEdge() method when provided with valid vertices u and v to make a connection from one vertex to another in the adjacency list.
 Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a AllPathsFromSourceToTarget instance, providing an appropriate number of vertices. Use the addEdge() method previously to set up a known configuration and save it for testing.
  Act: Call the addEdge() method for this test, to add a connection between two vertices.
  Assert: Use the method 'allPathsFromSourceToTarget()' to check if the vertices have been correctly connected via the last added edge.
 Validation:
  This assertion should verify the correct functioning of the addEdge() method when provided with valid integers representing vertices. The significant of this test is to assure that edges are added correctly to the graph, since a wrongly added edge could potentially alter the entire route from source to destination.

Scenario 2: 'u' is valid, but 'v' is not present

Details:
 TestName: testAddEdgeWithInvalidVertex.
 Description: This test checks the addEdge() method to see if it handles invalid vertices correctly.
 Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an instance of AllPathsFromSourceToTarget with a known vertex configuration.
  Act: Call the addEdge() method with a valid 'u' vertex, but an invalid 'v' vertex.
  Assert: Since a invalid 'v' vertex would not be present in adjacency list, expect an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
 Validation:
  The assertion should verify that the program doesn't crash when given a vertex that is out of range, and that proper exception is thrown to inform about failure.

Scenario 3: 'u' and 'v' are both invalid

Details:
 TestName: testAddEdgeWithBothInvalidVertices.
 Description: This test will verify if the addEdge() method gracefully handles when provided with both invalid vertices.
 Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a AllPathsFromSourceToTarget instance with a known configuration.
  Act: Call the addEdge() method specifying two invalid vertices.
  Assert: Since both vertices would not be present in adjacency list, expect an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
 Validation:
  The assertion will verify that the add() method gracefully fails when called with invalid vertices, maintaining the integrity of the overall data structure and preventing a potential program crash.

Scenario 4: 'u' and 'v' is same valid vertex

Details:
 TestName: testAddEdgeWithSameVertices.
 Description: This test checks the addEdge() method to see if it correctly adds an edge from a vertex to itself. In a graph, a node can be connected to itself, which is perfectly valid.
 Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an instance of AllPathsFromSourceToTarget with a known vertex configuration.
  Act: Call the addEdge() method with a same value of 'u' and 'v' vertex.
  Assert: Use the method 'allPathsFromSourceToTarget' to check if it contains any routes that start and end on the same vertex.
 Validation:
  This test verifies that edges connecting a vertex to itself are handled correctly. The graph generated should correctly represent this situation.
