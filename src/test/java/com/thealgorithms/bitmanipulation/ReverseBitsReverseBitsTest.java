  Scenario 1: Validating with positive numbers having a mixed pattern of bits

  Details:
    TestName: testPositiveMixedBitPattern
    Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the method reverseBits with a positive number which have a mixed pattern of bits.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No set up required as the method uses primitive type as parameter.
    Act: Invoke reverseBits method with positive numbers having a mixed pattern of bits. For instance, we can use numbers like 5, 125 etc.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned int is the reverse bit format of the given number.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify the correctness of the bit reversal operation. The result would be considered correct if the bits of the returned number are exactly in reverse order of the supplied number's bits. This test checks the basic correctness of the function with varied bit patterns in positive numbers.

  Scenario 2: Validating with positive sequential number bits

  Details:
    TestName: testPositiveSequentialBitPattern
    Description: This test is designed to check the correctness of the function reverseBits with positive numbers with all bits set to 1 sequentially from least significant bit.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the input is primitive type.
    Act: Invoke reverseBits with positive numbers where bits are set to 1 sequentially from the least significant bit, like numbers 7 (111), 15 (1111) etc.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned number has bits set to 1 sequentially from the most significant bit.
  Validation:
    This test scenario is to ensure that the function correctly reverses the bits for positive numbers with sequential bit pattern. This test helps in validating the function's correctness when input has a specific sequential bit pattern.

  Scenario 3: Validating with negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test is designed to validate the correctness of the method reverseBits with negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The method requires no setup as it uses a primitive int type as a parameter.
    Act: Invoke the reverseBits method with negative numbers, such as -5, -10, etc.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned int represents a correct reverse bit pattern of the input number in two's complement form.
  Validation:
    The Assertion aims to verify that the bit reversal operation correctly handles negative numbers. The expected result is a reversed bit pattern of the input number in two's complement form. This test enhances the test coverage by ensuring that the function works correctly for negative numbers as well.
