"Scenario 1: Test BitSwap when both positions have the same bit value

Details:  
  TestName: testBitSwapSameBitValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the bitSwap method when the bits at both positions are the same. In this case, the original data should be returned as no bit swapping is needed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to set up any data as the data and positions are inputs for the method.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with data and two positions that have the same bit value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results (data returned by the method) against the expected outcomes (the original data).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the case where no bit swapping is needed. This test is significant as it checks the method's correctness when the bits at both positions are the same.

Scenario 2: Test BitSwap when both positions have different bit values

Details:  
  TestName: testBitSwapDifferentBitValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the bitSwap method when the bits at both positions are different. In this case, the data should be returned with the bits at the given positions swapped.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to set up any data as the data and positions are inputs for the method.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with data and two positions that have different bit values.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results (data returned by the method) against the expected outcomes (the data with the bits at the given positions swapped).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly swaps the bits at the given positions. This test is significant as it checks the method's correctness when the bits at both positions are different.

Scenario 3: Test BitSwap with invalid positions

Details:  
  TestName: testBitSwapInvalidPositions
  Description: This test is meant to check the bitSwap method when the positions provided are invalid (e.g., negative or larger than the number of bits in the data). The behavior in this case is not specified in the method description, but it would be useful to see how the method handles such inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to set up any data as the data and positions are inputs for the method.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with data and invalid positions.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method throws an exception or returns an error code.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify how the method handles invalid inputs. This test is significant as it checks the method's robustness and error handling.
