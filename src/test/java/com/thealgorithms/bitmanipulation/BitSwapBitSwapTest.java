"Scenario 1: Testing bitSwap when bits at given positions are already equal
Details:
    TestName: testBitSwapWhenBitsAreEqual
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the bitSwap method when the bits at given positions posA and posB in the input data are already the same. In such a case, no bit swap is necessary and the data should be returned as is.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an integer with bits at posA and posB being the same.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with the data and posA and posB as inputs.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is equal to the input data.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method returns the input data as is when no bit swap is necessary. This is as expected since swapping two identical bits doesn't change the value.

Scenario 2: Testing bitSwap when bits at given positions are different
Details:
    TestName: testBitSwapWhenBitsAreDifferent
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the bitSwap method when the bits at posA and posB in the input data are different. In such cases, bits should be swapped.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an integer with bits at posA and posB being different.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with the data and posA and posB as inputs.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is different from the input data (as bits have been swapped). The exact expected result can be calculated manually.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly swaps bits when they are different. This is as expected as it is the primary functionality of the bitSwap method.

Scenario 3: Testing bitSwap when data is zero
Details:
    TestName: testBitSwapWhenDataIsZero
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the bitSwap method when the data is zero. Since all bits in zero are 0, no matter what the positions, we expect the result to be zero as well.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use 0 as input data, positions can be anything.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with 0 and the position parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method works correctly when data is zero by returning 0. This makes sense as swapping any bits in 0 still results in 0.

Scenario 4: Testing bitSwap with negative data
Details:
    TestName: testBitSwapWithNegativeData
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the bitSwap method when the data is negative. The method should work properly with negative numbers as well since Java uses two's complement binary representation for negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a negative number as the input data, positions can be any valid values.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with the negative data and the positions parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value matches manual calculations since swapping bits in a negative number can change its value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the bitSwap method works correctly with negative numbers. This is significant as it ensures the method's functionality is not limited to positive values only.
