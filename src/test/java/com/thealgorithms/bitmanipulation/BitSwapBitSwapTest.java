Scenario 1: Verify bitSwap with same position
Details:  
  TestName: testBitSwapWithSamePosition
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check the functionality of bitSwap method when both the positions are same.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up any required data, i.e., data = 10, posA = posB = 1.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with data, posA and posB.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. Here, the expected outcome is 10.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that if both the positions are same, the bitSwap method should return the same number. This is because no swapping of bits is happening.

Scenario 2: Verify bitSwap with different positions
Details:  
  TestName: testBitSwapWithDifferentPositions
  Description: This test scenario is meant to verify the functionality of bitSwap method when the positions are different.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up any required data, i.e., data = 10, posA = 1, posB = 2.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with data, posA and posB.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. Here, the expected outcome is 12.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that if both the positions are different, the bitSwap method should return a new number after swapping the bits at given positions. 

Scenario 3: Verify bitSwap with position exceeding data size
Details:  
  TestName: testBitSwapWithPositionExceedingDataSize
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check the functionality of bitSwap method when one of the positions exceeds the size of data.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up any required data, i.e., data = 10, posA = 1, posB = 5.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with data, posA and posB.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. Here, the expected outcome is 42.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that if one of the positions exceeds the size of data, the bitSwap method should return a new number after swapping the bits at given positions. 

Scenario 4: Verify bitSwap with negative data
Details:  
  TestName: testBitSwapWithNegativeData
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check the functionality of bitSwap method when the data is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up any required data, i.e., data = -10, posA = 1, posB = 2.
    Act: Invoke the bitSwap method with data, posA and posB.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. Here, the expected outcome is -12.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that if the data is negative, the bitSwap method should return a new negative number after swapping the bits at given positions.
