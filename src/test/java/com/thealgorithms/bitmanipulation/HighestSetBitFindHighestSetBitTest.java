"Scenario 1: Test for Negative Numbers
Details:
    TestName: testForNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test is meant to check how the application handles negative numbers, which it is not designed to handle. The target scenario therefore involves negative number input.
Execution:
    Arrange: There is no necessary step for arrangement in this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the findHighestSetBit method with a negative number parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit to check that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
Validation:
    The IllegalArgumentException is thrown as the method is not designed to handle negative numbers. This test is important to ensure that an appropriate error is handed when a negative number is used as an input.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero
Details:
    TestName: testForZero
    Description: This test is meant to check the application's response when zero is used as an input. Zero is a valid input but has no set bit in binary representation.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the findHighestSetBit method with parameter 0.
    Assert: Use JUnit to assert that Optional.empty is returned by the method.
Validation:
    Optional.empty is returned because the number 0 has no bits set in its binary representation. This test is significant because it ensures that the system can handle zero correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Maximum Integer Value
Details:
    TestName: testForMaxInteger
    Description: The test is meant to check how the method behaves when it is given the maximum integer value possible as an input. This is supposed to help test the boundary conditions of the method.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary in this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the findHighestSetBit method with Integer.MAX_VALUE as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit to assert that the output of the method is not null and that it is equal to the floor value of Log base 2 of Integer.MAX_VALUE as this should be the position of the highest set bit.
Validation:
    The output should be equal to the floor value of Log base 2 of the input as this should be the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. This test helps ensure that the method correctly computes the highest set bit for very large input numbers.

Scenario 4: Test for Random Positive Number
Details:
    TestName: testForRandomPositiveInteger
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles random positive numbers. This is meant to simulate normal usage where any positive integer can be an input.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary in this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the findHighestSetBit method with a random positive integer parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit to assert that the output of the method is not null and that it is equal to the floor value of Log base 2 of the input as this should be the position of the highest set bit in binary representation.
Validation:
    The output should be equal to the floor value of Log base 2 of the input as this should be the position of the highest set bit in binary. This test helps ensure that the method calculates the highest set bit correctly for normal usage.
