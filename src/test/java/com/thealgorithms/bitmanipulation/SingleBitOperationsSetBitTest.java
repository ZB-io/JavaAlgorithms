Scenario 1: Testing setBit method with bit position out of range

Details:  
  TestName: testSetBitWithOutOfRangePosition
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setBit method when the bit position provided is out of the range for an int. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are dealing with static methods and primitive types.
  Act: Invoke setBit method with a bit position greater than 31.
  Assert: Expect an ArithmeticException due to the left shift operation on an int.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an ArithmeticException when a bit position out of range is provided. This is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the code.

Scenario 2: Testing setBit method with negative bit position

Details:  
  TestName: testSetBitWithNegativePosition
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setBit method when a negative bit position is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are dealing with static methods and primitive types.
  Act: Invoke setBit method with a negative bit position.
  Assert: Expect an ArithmeticException due to the left shift operation on an int.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an ArithmeticException when a negative bit position is provided. This is important to ensure the code handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Testing setBit method with negative number

Details:  
  TestName: testSetBitWithNegativeNumber
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setBit method when a negative number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are dealing with static methods and primitive types.
  Act: Invoke setBit method with a negative number.
  Assert: Expect the returned number to have the bit at the specified position set to 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly sets the bit at the specified position to 1 even when a negative number is provided. This is important for ensuring the method works correctly with all valid inputs.

Scenario 4: Testing setBit method with zero number and zero position

Details:  
  TestName: testSetBitWithZeroNumberAndPosition
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setBit method when zero is provided as the number and position.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are dealing with static methods and primitive types.
  Act: Invoke setBit method with zero as the number and position.
  Assert: Expect the returned number to be 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly sets the bit at the 0th position to 1 when the number is zero. This is important for ensuring the method works correctly with edge case inputs.
