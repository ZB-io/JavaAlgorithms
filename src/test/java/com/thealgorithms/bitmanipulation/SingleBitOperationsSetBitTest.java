""""
Scenario 1: Testing setBit method when bit is set to 0 and num is 0
Details: 
  TestName: testSetBitWhenBitIsZeroAndNumIsZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setBit method when both the 'num' and 'bit' parameters are set to 0. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as we are passing static values.
  Act: Invoke the setBit method with the parameters num=0 and bit=0.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a result of 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setBit method correctly sets the 0th bit to 1 in the integer 0. The expected result is 1 because setting the 0th bit of 0 to 1 results in 1. This test is significant in the context of validating the setBit method's logic.

Scenario 2: Testing setBit method when bit is set to a value greater than the number of bits in 'num'
Details: 
  TestName: testSetBitWhenBitIsGreaterThanNumBits
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setBit method when the 'bit' parameter is set to a value greater than the number of bits in 'num'. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as we are passing static values.
  Act: Invoke the setBit method with the parameters num=1 and bit=5.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a result of 33.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setBit method correctly sets the 5th bit to 1 in the integer 1. The expected result is 33 because setting the 5th bit of 1 to 1 results in 33. This test is significant in the context of validating the setBit method's logic when the 'bit' parameter is larger than the number of bits in 'num'.

Scenario 3: Testing setBit method when 'num' is negative
Details: 
  TestName: testSetBitWhenNumIsNegative
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setBit method when the 'num' parameter is negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as we are passing static values.
  Act: Invoke the setBit method with the parameters num=-10 and bit=1.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a result of -8.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setBit method correctly sets the 1st bit to 1 in the integer -10. The expected result is -8 because setting the 1st bit of -10 to 1 results in -8. This test is significant in the context of validating the setBit method's logic when the 'num' parameter is negative.
