Tests:
    "@Test
@Test
void testIsEven() {
    assertTrue(IsEven.isEven(0));
    assertTrue(IsEven.isEven(2));
    assertTrue(IsEven.isEven(-12));

"Scenario 1: Test with Positive Even Number

Details:  
    TestName: testWithPositiveEvenNumber
    Description: This test is meant to check the isEven method when a positive even number is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly passing the value.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with a positive even number.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies even numbers. The expected result is true because the passed number is even. This test is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the isEven method.

Scenario 2: Test with Positive Odd Number

Details:  
    TestName: testWithPositiveOddNumber
    Description: This test is meant to check the isEven method when a positive odd number is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly passing the value.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with a positive odd number.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies odd numbers. The expected result is false because the passed number is odd. This test is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the isEven method.

Scenario 3: Test with Zero

Details:  
    TestName: testWithZero
    Description: This test is meant to check the isEven method when zero is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly passing the value.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies zero as an even number. The expected result is true because zero is considered even. This test is significant as it tests the edge case of the isEven method.

Scenario 4: Test with Negative Even Number

Details:  
    TestName: testWithNegativeEvenNumber
    Description: This test is meant to check the isEven method when a negative even number is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly passing the value.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with a negative even number.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies negative even numbers. The expected result is true because the passed number is even. This test is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the isEven method with negative numbers.

Scenario 5: Test with Negative Odd Number

Details:  
    TestName: testWithNegativeOddNumber
    Description: This test is meant to check the isEven method when a negative odd number is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly passing the value.
    Act: Invoke the isEven method with a negative odd number.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies negative odd numbers. The expected result is false because the passed number is odd. This test is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the isEven method with negative numbers.
