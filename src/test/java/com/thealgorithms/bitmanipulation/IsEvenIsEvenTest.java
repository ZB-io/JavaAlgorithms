void testIsEven() {
    assertTrue(IsEven.isEven(0));
    assertTrue(IsEven.isEven(2));

"Scenario 1: Testing for a positive even number

Details:
  TestName: isEvenWithPositiveEvenNumber.
  Description: This test is to verify whether the method correctly identifies positive even numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange is needed as we only need to provide the number to the method.
  Act: Invoke the method with a positive even number like 10.
  Assert: Check if the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to confirm that the method can accurately identify positive even numbers. The functionality is key to determining even integers which is essential in certain mathematical calculations and operations in the application's logic.

Scenario 2: Testing for a positive odd number

Details:
  TestName: isEvenWithPositiveOddNumber.
  Description: This test is to verify whether the method accurately identifies positive odd numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange is needed as we only need to provide the number to the method.
  Act: Invoke the method with a positive odd number like 7.
  Assert: Check if the result is a false.
Validation:
  This assertion seeks to verify the method can identify positive odd numbers. This helps in performing specific operations that require the identification of odd or even integers.


Scenario 3: Testing with zero (which is technically an even number)

Details:
  TestName: isEvenWithZero.
  Description: This test is to confirm whether the method can identify zero as an even number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange is required as the method requires only an integer input.
  Act: Invoke the method with zero.
  Assert: Check if the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms if the method considers zero as an even integer. This is important in ensuring the accuracy of mathematical calculations.

Scenario 4: Testing for a negative even number

Details:
  TestName: isEvenWithNegativeEvenNumber.
  Description: In this test, we ensure that the method accurately identifies negative even numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange is required. We directly pass a negative even integer.
  Act: Invoke the method with a negative even number like -4.
  Assert: Check if the result comes out to be true.
Validation:
  This test validates whether the method can handle negative even integers which is important in certain calculations involving negative numbers within the application.

Scenario 5: Testing for a negative odd number

Details:
  TestName: isEvenWithNegativeOddNumber.
  Description: This test is designed to verify whether the method accurately identifies negative odd numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange is required. We provide a negative odd number directly to the method.
  Act: Call the method with a negative odd number like -3.
  Assert: Check if the result comes out as false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can successfully handle negative odd numbers, which is crucial in various arithmetic operations involving negative numbers.
