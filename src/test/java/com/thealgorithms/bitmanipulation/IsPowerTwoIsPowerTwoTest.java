"Scenario 1: Test for large positive power of two numbers

Details:
  TestName: testLargePositivePowerOfTwo
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies large positive numbers that are powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required since we are testing with static input.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with a large positive number that is a power of two.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies large positive powers of two. This test ensures that the method can handle large numbers and still provide accurate results.

Scenario 2: Test for large negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testLargeNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies large negative numbers as not being powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required since we are testing with static input.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with a large negative number.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that negative numbers, regardless of their magnitude, are not powers of two. This is important as it verifies the method's ability to handle negative inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for positive numbers that are not powers of two

Details:
  TestName: testPositiveNonPowerOfTwo
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies positive numbers that are not powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required since we are testing with static input.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with a positive number that is not a power of two.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies positive numbers that are not powers of two. This is important as it checks the method's accuracy in distinguishing between numbers that are powers of two and those that are not.

Scenario 4: Test for zero

Details:
  TestName: testZeroInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies zero as not being a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required since we are testing with static input.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies zero as not being a power of two. This is crucial as zero is a special case and the method should handle it correctly.
