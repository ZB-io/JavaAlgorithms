"Scenario 1: Test with large positive power of two numbers

Details:
  TestName: testWithLargePositivePowerOfTwo
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the isPowerTwo method when inputted with large positive power of two numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as the method does not need any setup.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with a large positive power of two number.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies large positive power of two numbers. This is significant as it ensures the method can handle and correctly process large inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with large negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testWithLargeNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the isPowerTwo method when inputted with large negative numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as the method does not need any setup.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with a large negative number.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that negative numbers are not power of two. This is significant as it ensures the method can handle and correctly process negative inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with positive numbers that are not power of two

Details:
  TestName: testWithNonPowerOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the isPowerTwo method when inputted with positive numbers that are not power of two. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as the method does not need any setup.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with a positive number that is not a power of two.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that not all positive numbers are power of two. This is significant as it ensures the method can correctly identify non power of two numbers.

Scenario 4: Test with zero

Details:
  TestName: testWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the isPowerTwo method when inputted with zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as the method does not need any setup.
  Act: Invoke the isPowerTwo method with zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that zero is not a power of two. This is significant as it ensures the method can correctly identify zero as a non power of two number.
