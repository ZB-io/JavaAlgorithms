"Scenario 1: Test Case with a large power of Two
Details:  
  TestName: givenLargePowerOfTwoShouldReturnTrue
  Description: To test if the method correctly identifies a large number (not a common power of 2) which is a power of 2.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Nothing to arrange, as the method does not require datastore or other dependencies. 
    Act: Pass a large power of two as an argument to isPowerTwo, for example, 2147483648 (2^31).
    Assert: Use assertTrue() to verify if the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the function handles large integer numbers that are powers of two and will return true.
    This could be important in scenarios where the method is used for processing large datasets or long bit strings.   

Scenario 2: Test Case for Positive Non-Power of Two 
 Details: 
   TestName: givenPositiveNonPowerOfTwoShouldReturnFalse
   Description: To check if the method works correctly on an odd number that is not a power of two. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required. 
    Act: Call the method isPowerTwo and pass an odd integer number, such as 63.
    Assert: Expect a false output from the method. We will assert this using the assertFalse() function.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the function will return false for positive integers that are not a power of two.
    It assures that the function is performing the bit operation correctly, and hence cannot be tricked by numbers that are close to a power of two.

Scenario 3: Test Case for Zero
 Details:
   TestName: givenZeroShouldReturnFalse
   Description: To test if the method correctly identifies zero as not a power of two. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required.
    Act: Pass 0 as an argument to the function.
    Assert: The function should return false as 0 is not a power of two.
  Validation: 
    This test is important to ensure that function handles boundary case where input is zero and will return false.
    It confirms that the functionality of checking if a number is a power of two does not imply that zero is considered a power of two by the function.
  
Scenario 4: Test Case for a negative number that is not a power of Two
Details:  
  TestName: givenNegativeNumberShouldReturnFalse
  Description: To check if a negative integer that is not a power of two is correctly identified as such.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: No arrangement required.
    Act: Call isPowerTwo with a negative number as input, such as -7. 
    Assert: The function should return false because negative numbers can never be a power of two.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that method correctly handles negative numbers.
    It adds robustness to the code by confirming that it handles negative numbers correctly and according to the specified business logic.
