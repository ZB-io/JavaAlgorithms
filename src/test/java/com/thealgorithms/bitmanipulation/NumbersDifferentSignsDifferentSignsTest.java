"Scenario 1: Test with both input numbers as zero
Details:
  TestName: testBothZeros
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method `differentSigns` correctly identifies that zero does not have a sign and thus two zeros do not have different signs
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test scenario
  Act: Invoke the method `differentSigns` with both parameters as zero
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check that the return value is false
Validation:
  The assertion is checking that when both numbers are zero, the method correctly returns false. This behavior is consistent with the definition that zero does not hold a negative or positive sign.

Scenario 2: Test with one input number as zero and the other one is a positive number
Details:
  TestName: testZeroAndPositive
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method `differentSigns` correctly identifies that zero and a positive number do not have different signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test scenario
  Act: Invoke the method `differentSigns` with one parameter as zero and the other one as a positive number
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check that the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion is checking that, when one number is zero and the other one is a positive number, the method correctly returns false. This behavior aligns with the definition that zero doesn't hold a negative sign.

Scenario 3: Test with one input number as zero and the other one is a negative number
Details:
  TestName: testZeroAndNegative
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method `differentSigns` correctly identifies that zero and a negative number have different signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test scenario
  Act: Invoke the method `differentSigns` with one parameter as zero and the other one as a negative number
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check that the return value is true.
Validation:
  The assertion is checking that, when one number is zero and the other one is a negative number, the method correctly returns true. This behavior signifies that zero, which does not hold a positive or negative sign, is opposite to any number that has a negative sign.
