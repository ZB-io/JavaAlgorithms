"Scenario 1: Test for Two Positive Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies that two positive numbers have the same sign. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are directly providing the input numbers. 
  Act: Invoke the differentSigns method with two positive numbers as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies two positive numbers as having the same sign. This is important in the context of the application's number sign identification logic.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero and a Positive Number
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsZeroPositiveNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies that zero and a positive number have different signs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are directly providing the input numbers. 
  Act: Invoke the differentSigns method with zero and a positive number as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies zero and a positive number as having different signs. This is crucial for the application's number sign identification logic.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero and a Negative Number
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsZeroNegativeNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies that zero and a negative number have different signs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are directly providing the input numbers. 
  Act: Invoke the differentSigns method with zero and a negative number as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies zero and a negative number as having different signs. This is crucial for the application's number sign identification logic.

Scenario 4: Test for Two Zero Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsTwoZeroNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies that two zero numbers have the same sign. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as we are directly providing the input numbers. 
  Act: Invoke the differentSigns method with two zero numbers as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies two zero numbers as having the same sign. This is important in the context of the application's number sign identification logic.
