"Scenario 1: Test for Two Positive Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsPositivePositive
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly identifies two positive numbers as having the same sign.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the method with two positive numbers, such as 5 and 3.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies two positive numbers as not having different signs. This is important to ensure the method accurately identifies numbers with the same sign.

Scenario 2: Test for Two Negative Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsNegativeNegative
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly identifies two negative numbers as having the same sign.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the method with two negative numbers, such as -5 and -3.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies two negative numbers as not having different signs. This is crucial for the accurate identification of numbers with the same sign.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero and Positive Number
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsZeroPositive
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly identifies zero and a positive number as not having different signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the method with zero and a positive number, such as 0 and 3.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies zero and a positive number as not having different signs. This is significant in scenarios where zero is considered a positive number.

Scenario 4: Test for Zero and Negative Number
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsZeroNegative
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly identifies zero and a negative number as having different signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the method with zero and a negative number, such as 0 and -3.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies zero and a negative number as having different signs. This is significant in scenarios where zero is not considered a negative number.

Scenario 5: Test for Zero and Zero
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentSignsZeroZero
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly identifies zero and zero as not having different signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the method with zero and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies zero and zero as not having different signs. This is significant for accurate identification of numbers with the same sign.
