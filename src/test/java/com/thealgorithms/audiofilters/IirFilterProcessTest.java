Scenario 1: Testing the process of a positive sample

Details:
    TestName: testProcessingOfPositiveSample
    Description: This test scenario is meant to assess the successful demonstration of processing a positive sample.
    Execution:
        Arrange: We need to set up the preconditions, which involve setting coefficients using the provided setCoeffs method.
        Act:  We would then invoke the process method with a positive sample.
        Assert: We should assert that the processed sample is not zero.
    Validation:
        This test verifies that the process method can handle positive samples without throwing an exception, and it returns a non-zero processed sample. This test is essential to ensure that the "process" method can handle positive sample inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing the process of a negative sample

Details:
    TestName: testProcessingOfNegativeSample
    Description: This test scenario is designed to verify the successful processing of a negative sample.
    Execution:
        Arrange: We need to set up the preconditions, which involve setting coefficients using the provided setCoeffs method.
        Act:  We would then invoke the process method with a negative sample.
        Assert: We can assert that the processed sample is not zero.
    Validation:
        This test confirms that the process method can handle negative samples without throwing an exception, and it returns a non-zero processed sample. This test is crucial to ensure that the "process" method can handle negative sample inputs.

Scenario 3: Testing the process of sample zero

Details:
    TestName: testProcessingOfSampleZero
    Description: This test is meant to check the 'process' method behavior when processing a sample of value zero.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Set up the necessary coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
        Act:  Invoke the process method with a sample of value zero.
        Assert: We should assert that the processed sample is also zero.
    Validation:
        This test validates that the process method can handle a sample of zero and return zero, in line with the algorithm applied in the process method.

Scenario 4: Testing the process of a sample without setting coefficients

Details:
    TestName: testProcessingWithoutSettingCoefficients
    Description: This test scenario is designed to ensure that the process method throws an exception when it's running without setting coefficients.
    Execution:
        Arrange: No need to set coefficients.
        Act: Invoke the process method with any sample.
        Assert: An exception should be thrown.
    Validation:
        This test scenario is to ensure that the process method cannot run without setting the coefficients first. Therefore, the app's stability and error-checking ability are ensured.
