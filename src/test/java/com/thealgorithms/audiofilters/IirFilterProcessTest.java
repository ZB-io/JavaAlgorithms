Scenario 1: Test for processing a valid sample

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessValidSample
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly processes a valid sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid sample and coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the valid sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly processes the sample. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula implemented in the method. This test is significant to ensure the correct behavior of the process method.

Scenario 2: Test for processing a zero sample

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessZeroSample
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a zero sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a zero sample and coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the zero sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a zero sample. The expected result is zero as the sample itself is zero. This test is significant to ensure the correct behavior of the process method when dealing with edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test for processing a negative sample

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessNegativeSample
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a negative sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a negative sample and coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the negative sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a negative sample. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula implemented in the method. This test is significant to ensure the correct behavior of the process method when dealing with negative values.

Scenario 4: Test for processing a sample without setting coefficients

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessWithoutSettingCoefficients
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a case where the coefficients are not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid sample.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the sample without setting coefficients.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when the coefficients are not set. This test is significant to ensure the correct error handling of the process method.
