"""
Scenario 1: Test for processing a valid sample

Details:
  TestName: testProcessValidSample
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly processes a valid sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid sample and coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the valid sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly processes the sample. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula implemented in the method. This test is significant to ensure the method works correctly under standard conditions.

Scenario 2: Test for processing a zero sample

Details:
  TestName: testProcessZeroSample
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a zero sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a zero sample and coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the zero sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a zero sample. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula implemented in the method. This test is important to ensure the method handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for processing a negative sample

Details:
  TestName: testProcessNegativeSample
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a negative sample.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a negative sample and coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the negative sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a negative sample. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula implemented in the method. This test is crucial to ensure the method handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for processing a sample with zero coefficients

Details:
  TestName: testProcessSampleWithZeroCoefficients
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a sample when coefficients are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sample and zero coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a sample when coefficients are zero. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula implemented in the method. This test is important to ensure the method handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 5: Test for processing a sample with negative coefficients

Details:
  TestName: testProcessSampleWithNegativeCoefficients
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a sample when coefficients are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sample and negative coefficients using the setCoeffs method.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
